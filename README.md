## 2. Installation
### 2.1 Clone this project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeepWay/PaT.git
```
After cloning, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd PaT
```

### 2.2 Create new conda environment
If you want to create the new conda environment, you can execute the following commands.

```bash

## 4. Usage example
### 4.1 Run the main methods with configuration files
All experiment configuration files (.yaml) are organized under the [/settings](/settings/) directory, categorized by different network types (e.g., main, hybrid_net, multi_layer, cnn_net, etc.).

```bash
# 10x10
python main.py --config_path settings/main/v1_PPO-h200-c02-n64-b32-R15-transform3_TF,64,4,256,0,1-k1-rA-T.yaml

# 20x20
python main.py --config_path settings/main/v2_PPO-h400-c02-n64-b32-R15-transform3_TF,64,4,256,0,1-k1-rA-T.yaml

# 40x40
python main.py --config_path settings/main/v3_PPO-h1600-c02-n64-b32-R15-transform3_TF,64,4,256,0,1-k1-rA-T.yaml
```

For more examples, please refer to the [scripts/all.sh](scripts/all.sh) script, which contains the complete commands for all experiments in the thesis. 

Each command corresponds to specific YAML configuration files in the [settings/](/settings/) directory, ensuring experimental reproducibility and systematic management.

For more details about the configuration files, please refer to the [update_yaml_files](utils.py#L69) function in the [utils.py](/utils.py) file. 

You can copy a template from [settings/main/v1_PPO-h200-c02-n64-b32-R15-transform3_TF,64,4,256,0,1-k1-rA-T.yaml](settings/main/v1_PPO-h200-c02-n64-b32-R15-transform3_TF,64,4,256,0,1-k1-rA-T.yaml) and rename the copied file according to your experiment, and then use the [update_yaml_files](utils.py#L69) function to update the content in YAML file.

Training and Testing are stored in `/logs/ppo/2DBpp-vX_PPO-*` folder, generated and named based on the filename of the given YAML configuration file.

If you want to formatting testing results, you can run [formatted_result](utils.py#L13) function in the [utils.py](/utils.py) file. This function will extract testing results from `eval_50_20.txt` under each sub-folder to a single `csv` file.

For the usage of plotting training figure, you can see the [example](utils.py#L406) in  [utils.py](/utils.py) file.

### 4.2 Choose training, testing mode, or both
You can choose to run the training, testing, or both modes by adding the `--mode` flag into the command, you can also set it to `train` or `test`, or `both`. If you don't set the `--mode` flag, it will default to `both` mode.

For example, if you want to run the testing phase after completing training phase, you can execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py --mode test --config_path settings/main/v1_PPO-h200-c02-n64-b32-R15-transform3_TF,64,4,256,0,1-k1-rA-T.yaml
```

### 4.3 Watch the training process in tensorboard (Optional)
if you want to watch the training process in tensorboard, you can execute the following command in the terminal:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/
```

### 4.4 Upload the training process to wandb (Optional)
If you want to upload the training results to Weights & Biases (wandb), you need to add the `--use_wandb` flag to the command. For example:

```bash
# 10x10
python main.py --config_path settings/main/v1_PPO-h200-c02-n64-b32-R15-transform3_TF,64,4,256,0,1-k1-rA-T.yaml --use_wandb
```

After executing the above command, you will be asked to choose the visualization mode like below.

```bash
wandb: (1) Create a W&B account
wandb: (2) Use an existing W&B account
wandb: (3) Don't visualize my results
wandb: Enter your choice: 
```
If you want to visualize the training results on the wandb website, you can choose the second option, and then you will be asked to paste the API key of your wandb account. 

If you don't have one, you can choose the first option to create a new account.

If you just want to save the training results locally, you can choose the third option.

### 4.5 Visualize the bin packing process (Optional)
If you want to watch the progress of the bin packing process, you can run `UI.py` file, which provides a Gradio-based interface to visualize the bin packing process.

```bash
python UI.py
```

There is also an online demo hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, running on a free CPU. You can try it out [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JeepWay/PaT_2D_Bin_Packing_Environment).

## 5. Use docker images (Optional)
For more detail of `make` command, please refer to the [Makefile](Makefile).

### Build docker image
Build CPU image:
```bash
make docker-cpu
```
Build GPU image (with nvidia-docker):
```bash
make docker-gpu
```

### Run GPU images
Run the nvidia-container-toolkit GPU image
```bash
docker run -it --rm --gpus=all --volume $(pwd):/home/user/pat jeepway/pat-gpu:latest bash -c "cd /home/user/pat && ls && pwd && /bin/bash"
```

Or, use `make` command to run with the shell file
```bash
make docker-run-gpu
```
After executing the above command, you will enter the terminal of the container.

### Run CPU images
Run the docker CPU image
```bash
docker run -it --rm --volume $(pwd):/home/user/pat jeepway/pat-cpu:latest bash -c "cd /home/user/pat && ls && pwd && /bin/bash"
```

Or, use `make` command to run with the shell file
```bash
make docker-run-cpu
```
After executing the above command, you will enter the terminal of the container.
